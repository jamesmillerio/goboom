# goboom
A port of [Zach Holman's](http://zachholman.com/) [boom text snippet app](https://github.com/holman/boom) to Go.

## About
I'm still working out the kinks (no tests?! *faint*) so use at your own risk. In fact, you're better off using Zach's app if you have critical data you don't want borked until I bang on it more and get some more tests defined. I guess what I'm trying to say is... *maybe* make a backup of your .boom file first.
